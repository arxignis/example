# Datadog Security Workflow

A Datadog workflow that automatically responds to security signals by extracting malicious IP addresses and services, creating an investigative notebook, and notifying security responders via Slack. Responders can then choose to either block the IPs directly in Arxignis or create a security incident for further investigation.

## Features

- Automatically triggers on Datadog security signals
- Extracts IP addresses and affected services from security signal data
- Creates an investigative notebook for security analysis
- Sends interactive Slack notifications with action options
- Supports direct IP blocking in Arxignis or incident creation
- Includes retry logic for API calls to Arxignis
